Python implementation of the method of measuring galactic conformity developed in Sin, Lilly, and Henriques (2019) (https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09543).

In addition, there is an implementation of an observational galaxy group finder adapted from Tinker et al. (2011) (https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.5046).

Finally, <code>SLH2020_pub/</code> contains the scripts used to apply this analysis in an observational group-based context, as part of an upcoming paper.
